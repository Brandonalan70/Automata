## Automata Inc. Database Creation
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a relational database management system (RDBMS) for a fictional auto parts company. The primary objective is to support various user queries and provide meaningful insights through the database. As a team, we were responsible for defining the data requirements, developing a conceptual model, and ultimately translating these into a fully functional PostgreSQL database.
